											<h3>BLOOM - All in One Fitness Application</h3>
											<h5>Tags - Flutter,Andriod Developement,UI/UX design , User-friendly,Recommendation Model,Analytics Report System,Personalized,Platform Independent</h5>
											<p>BLOOM is a fitness application made with Flutter. Features in giving personal diet suggesstions , excersise tracking , pedometer and sleep tracking . The user can calculate their BMI anytime to keep a check of their overall fitness . Monthly tracking of user growth towards their goals are done and provided in the form of downloadable file into their device automatically. </p>
											<p><b>Future Improvemets</b> - I would like to enable a suggesstion model for the users that cannot stick to the diet plan or excersise routine due to their work or life So that if a user skips checking into the app one day, the diet plan and other plans of user should be upgraded with some changes to ultimately reach the goal without any extra efforts.</p>
											<p><b>(Please spare some seconds to read this idea of mine,feedbacks and comments are always appreciated.Thank You )</b>Example - If today due to an important event I am not able to check in the excersise plan . Let X will be the amount of energy I need to cover this gap in the ultimate goal of losing 5 kgs I skipped today. Then Bloom will either customize the excersie chart of next day with a different set of excersie that can cover X or will add something in my diet plan accordingly. Also , this X is different for every user according to their specifications and patterns of following Bloom in accordance with the goal to achieve within the time frame.</p>
